(0db) The Xr0 Static Debugger for C
Copyright (C) 2024 Xr0

A static debugger is the compile-time analogue of
runtime debuggers like GDB. Runtime debuggers
require you to execute a program in order to
analyse it, but 0db shows line-by-line the state
of a C program on the basis of the semantics of
the language alone.

This matters because at runtime we interact with a
very tiny subset of a program's possible
behaviours. In the state supplied by 0db you see
at once what applies to all possible executions
of a program.
