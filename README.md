# Xr0 â€“ C But Safe

Xr0 is a verifier for C that aims to guarantee the safety of C programs at
compile time. It will eliminate common pitfalls such as use-after-frees, double
frees, buffer out-of-bounds reads/writes, null pointer dereferences, uses of
uninitialised memory, arithmetic overflows/underflows and all other instances of
undefined behaviour in C.

## Getting started

Check out the [tutorial](https://xr0.dev/learn) on the website.

## Contributing

The best way to contribute to Xr0 is to use it for something.

In that regard, we're forming a cohort for the first few users of Xr0.
Participation in the cohort will come with support and prioritisation (within
reason) of features in our roadmap as we work towards making Xr0 useful for
everyone.
And best of all, it'll be completely free.
The only thing is there's two of us, so we'll have to keep the cohort fairly
small.
Reach out via email to
[Claude](mailto:betz@xr0.dev) or
[Amisi](mailto:a@xr0.dev) or DM us on the
[Xr0 Discord](https://discord.com/invite/yfx69tbhxQ) if you're interested in this.

We are currently not accepting pull requests due to the early stage of Xr0.
However, if you have a serious proposal for how we can improve Xr0 you can
[make an issue](https://github.com/xr0-org/xr0/issues/new) to explain it.
